The first step is to setup a repository on GitHub where you are going to put all your code. This is required, because at a later stage you will setup Azure to trigger a build and release, each time you do a push to your repository.

So login to your GitHub account and create a repository.

Once you have created a repository, it's time to get it to your local system and start hacking. But before you do that, please make sure that you have Git installed on your system, if not head on to Git download page and set it up. It's easy!

Now, on GitHub, select the repository you have just created. To the right you should see "Clone or download" button, click on it and you have the URL to clone your repository.
